            var, let and const keywords in JavaScript
        </h1>

        <p>
            In JavaScript, users can declare a variable using 3 keywords that are var, let, and const. In this article, we will see the differences between the var, let, and const keywords. We will discuss the scope about each keyword.
        </p>
        <div id="var " class="space-y-5">

        <h5>
            <span class="font-bold"> var:
            </span> 
            The var is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in JavaScript.
        </h5> 
        
        <h5>
           <span class="font-bold">
            Scope:
           </span> 

            Global scoped or function scoped. The scope of the var keyword is the global or function scope. It means variables defined outside the function can be accessed globally, and variables defined inside a particular function can be accessed within the function. 
        </h5>
       
        <h5>
            <span class="font-bold">
                Example 1:
            </span>
             Variable <strong>'a'</strong> is declared globally. So, the scope of the variable <strong>'a'</strong> is global, and it can be accessible everywhere in the program. 
        </h5>
        <code class="text-blue-700">
            var a = 10 <br>
            function f() { <br>
                console.log(a) <br>
            }<br>
            f();<br>
            console.log(a);<br>

        </code>


        <h5>
            <span class="font-bold">
                Example 2:
            </span>
            
             The variable <strong>'a'</strong> is declared inside the function. If the user tries to access it outside the function, it will display the error. Users can declare the 2 variables with the same name using the var keyword. Also, the user can reassign the value into the var variable. 
        </h5>
        <code class="text-blue-700">
            function f() { <br>

                // It can be accessible any where within this function <br>
                var a = 10; <br>
                console.log(a)<br>
            }<br>
            f();<br>
            
            // A cannot be accessible outside of function<br>
            console.log(a);<br>
            

        </code>
 

        <h5>
            <span class="font-bold">
                Example 3:
            </span>
            
            If users use the var variable before the declaration, it initializes with the undefined value. 
        </h5>
        <code class="text-blue-700">
          
            console.log(a);<br>
            let a = 10;<br>

        </code>
    </div>


    <div id="let">
        <h5>
            <span class="font-bold"> let:
            </span> 
            The let keyword is an improved version of the var keyword. 
        </h5> 
        
        <h5>
           <span class="font-bold">
            Scope:
           </span> 

           The scope of a let variable is only block scoped. It can not be accessible outside the particular block ({block}). Let's see the below example.
        </h5>
       
        <h5>
            <span class="font-bold">
                Example 1:

                Example 2:
            </span>
            
            The code returns an error because we are accessing the let variable outside the function block.
        </h5>
        <code class="text-blue-700">
          
            function f() { <br>

            If users use the let variable before the declaration, it does not initialize with undefined just like a var variable, and returns an error.

    <div id="const">
        <h5>
            <span class="font-bold"> let:
            </span> 
            The const keyword has all the properties that are the same as the let keyword, except the user cannot update it.

        <h5>
           <span class="font-bold">

           block scoped: When users declare a const variable, they need to initialize it, otherwise, it returns an error. The user cannot update the const variable once it is declared.

            Use cases of null and undefined
        </h1>

        <p>
            There are several differences between null and undefined, which are sometimes understood as the same. When we define a variable to undefined then we are trying to convey that the variable does not exist . When we define a variable to null then we are trying to convey that the variable is empty.

            It is the intentional absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of JavaScript.

            <span class="font-bold"> Undefined:

            It means the value does not exist in the compiler. It is the global object.

            REST API
        </h1>

        <p>
            Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. REST API is a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way without having any processing. REST technology is generally preferred to the more robust Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) technology because REST uses less bandwidth, simple and flexible making it more suitable for internet usage. It's used to fetch or give some information from a web service. All communication done via REST API uses only HTTP request.

            <span class="font-bold">
                 Working:
            </span> 
            A request is sent from client to server in the form of a web URL as HTTP GET or POST or PUT or DELETE request. After that, a response comes back from the server in the form of a resource which can be anything like HTML, XML, Image, or JSON. But now JSON is the most popular format being used in Web Services. In HTTP there are five methods that are commonly used in a REST-based Architecture i.e., POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations respectively. There are other methods which are less frequently used like OPTIONS and HEAD.  
        </p>
     
        <ul class="list-disc space-y-5 ml-4">
            <li>

                    <span class="font-bold">
                    GET: 
                    </span>
                
                    The HTTP GET method is used to read (or retrieve) a representation of a resource. In the safe path, GET returns a representation in XML or JSON and an HTTP response code of 200 (OK). In an error case, it most often returns a 404 (NOT FOUND) or 400 (BAD REQUEST). 
                </p>

                    PUT:  
                </span>
               
                   It is used for updating the capabilities. However, PUT can also be used to create a resource in the case where the resource ID is chosen by the client instead of by the server. In other words, if the PUT is to a URI that contains the value of a non-existent resource ID. On successful update, return 200 (or 204 if not returning any content in the body) from a PUT. If using PUT for create, return HTTP status 201 on successful creation. PUT is not safe operation but it,s idempotent.

                    PATCH:   
                </span>
                
                    It is used to modify capabilities. The PATCH request only needs to contain the changes to the resource, not the complete resource. This resembles PUT, but the body contains a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the server should be modified to produce a new version. This means that the PATCH body should not just be a modified part of the resource, but in some kind of patch language like JSON Patch or XML Patch. PATCH is neither safe nor idempotent.

                    It is used to delete a resource identified by a URI. On successful deletion, return HTTP status 200 (OK) along with a response body.
